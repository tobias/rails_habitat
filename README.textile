h2. rails_habitat plugin

A stupid simple plugin based on the idea behind Coda Hale's "rails_environments plugin":http://blog.codahale.com/2006/04/09/rails-environments-a-plugin-for-well-rails/

This plugin adds the following functionality to the Rails module to
help with determining the current enviroment, and is feature
compatible with rails_environments:

<pre>
  >> Rails.environment       # a convenience alias to Rails.env
  => "development"
  >> Rails.development?
  => true
  >> Rails.not_development?
  => false
  >> Rails.production?
  => false
  >> Rails.not_production?
  => true
  >> Rails.test?
  => false
  >> Rails.not_test?
  => true
</pre>

Not only does it provide @env?@ and @not_env?@ methods for the standard
environments, it also provides those methods for any environment you
define in config/environments/ (in fact that is how it learns about all
of the environments, including the standard three). So if you define
new environments in config/environments/ they will be picked up
automatically. 

The value of this plugin is diminished by rails 2.2, which allows you
to do @Rails.env.development?@.

Install with: @script/plugin install git://github.com/tobias/rails_habitat.git@
